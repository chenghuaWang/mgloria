## MKL
All of CPU based matrix computation is using Intel-MKL. You can use the `install_intel_mkl.sh` to install the Intel-MKL to your linux machine. This script can only be run on Ubuntu. If you are using Windows, you should visit the official website. 

## CUDAToolKits
The GPU backend is based on the cuda tool kits. I provide script for ubuntu20.04 and wsl to install the cuda tool kits.
